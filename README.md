# xiaomi-360-1080p-reroute-cloud
Small hack to disconnect the Xiaomi 360 1080p Camera from its cloud server based on the work of telmomarques (https://github.com/telmomarques/xiaomi-360-1080p-hacks)

Basically it adds a static route to nowhere for the cloud servers ( de.ot.io.mi.com &  gm.iotcplatform.com) on startup. Working in Germany, properbly you need to modify de.ot.io.mi.com for other places.

Before running replace the placeholder in the script (<nongw>) with the nongw of your choice.
